# Rock, Paper, Scissors

This project focuses on well-known game of [Rock, Paper, Scissors - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_paper_scissors "Rock, Paper Scissors") where vanilla Javascript is used. The player (client-side user) plays against the computer through five rounds.

As my first programming language, I perceive Javascript as this whimsical entity. The labyrinth of information; both abstract and conceptually fresh to my brain, have been quite eye-opening as a learner, and have personally made me appreciate the programming realm way more than I have before. I've covered over vital data in regards to Javascript's subprograms called functions, which are highly prominent throughout the language.

 Loops and iterations have taught me plenty about handing over mundane repetition to computers, allowing for a less tedious workflow. Loops are not without their own error-prone downfalls, as I was personally faced with unintentionally coding an infinite loop. I most certainly learned my lesson after my loop proceeded running without terminating. From there, through first-hand experience, it is deemed most essential in preventing infinite loops from occurring, as my browser simultaneously lagged and became unresposive.

The browser's web console is incredibly useful with the debugging process, and has lessen the technical headaches I endured while working on this project. 

As I learn even more about Javascript, I'm looking forward in improving this game using what I am currently learning about using DOM manipulation and the magical Events to liven things up.
